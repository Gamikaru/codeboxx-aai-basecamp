Below is a **fact sheet** that highlights important points you should keep in mind when working with the **UK House Price Index (UK HPI)** data.

Below is a **quick summary** of the **data types and formats** you can expect in the UK House Price Index (UK HPI) dataset based on the documentation.

---

## **1. File Formats**
- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):**  
  - Released monthly in a specific column order (often **no column headers** in the raw files).
  - Designed for easy bulk download and processing in spreadsheet tools or programming languages.
- **Linked Data (e.g., Turtle/RDF):**  
  - Offers structured data for integration with semantic web technologies.

---

## **2. Columns and Data Types**
> The published data is typically arranged in **consistent columns** (though not always labeled in the raw CSV). Below are the main columns and their likely data types:

1. **Date**  
   - *Type*: String representing a **year-month** (for example, “2025-01”) or full date.  
   - Typically needs **parsing** if you want to treat it as a date/datetime object.

2. **RegionName**  
   - *Type*: Text (string).  
   - Describes the geographical area (country, region, county/unitary authority, or London borough).

3. **AreaCode**  
   - *Type*: Text (string).  
   - Geographical code for that region or local authority (e.g., “E09000001” for some London borough).

4. **Average Price**  
   - *Type*: Numeric (float).  
   - A *geometric mean* “standardized” average house price for the specified date and region.

5. **Index**  
   - *Type*: Numeric (float).  
   - House Price Index for the date/region (base = 100 in January 2015).

6. **IndexSA** (Seasonally Adjusted Index)  
   - *Type*: Numeric (float).  
   - Seasonally adjusted version of the Index, available **only** at regional/national level.

7. **1m%change**  
   - *Type*: Numeric (float).  
   - Month-to-month percentage change in the **Average Price** (or other sub-indicator).

8. **12m%change**  
   - *Type*: Numeric (float).  
   - Annual (year-on-year) percentage change.

9. **AveragePricesSA** (Seasonally Adjusted Average Price)  
   - *Type*: Numeric (float).  
   - Seasonally adjusted average price (only at certain geography levels).

10. **Sales Volume**  
    - *Type*: Integer.  
    - Number of *registered* transactions for that area/month (partial data for the newest months).

### **Property-Type-Specific Columns**  
- You may see repeated columns (Price, Index, 1m%change, 12m%change) prefixed by:
  - **[Property Type]**: e.g., *DetachedPrice, Semi-detachedIndex*, etc.  
  - **[Cash/Mortgage]**: e.g., *CashPrice, Mortgage1m%change*, etc.  
  - **[FTB/FOO]** (First-Time Buyer / Former Owner Occupier).  
  - **[New/Old]** (New build vs. existing property).

These columns mirror the main “average price” or “index” columns but **restricted** to a particular subset (like detached houses, cash sales, new builds, etc.).

**Examples:**
- **DetachedPrice** – float, average price for detached properties.
- **MortgageSales Volume** – integer, number of mortgage-financed transactions.
- **FTB12m%change** – float, year-on-year % change for first-time buyer prices.

## **3. Interpreting the Data**
1. **No Column Headers in Some CSVs**  
   - The downloadable CSV files may come with columns in a fixed order but **no explicit headers**. You’ll need to **map** them yourself using the official documentation’s column list.

2. **Geometric Mean vs. Arithmetic Mean**  
   - The **Average Price** is based on a *geometric mean* to limit skew from very high-value transactions.

3. **Seasonal Adjustment**  
   - Some columns (e.g., *IndexSA*, *AveragePricesSA*) are seasonally adjusted, which helps account for seasonal sales patterns.

4. **Revisions**  
   - The data for recent months is **provisional**, and columns like *Sales Volume* or *[New/Old] Sales Volume* can change in future releases as more registrations come in.

5. **Potential Data Gaps**  
   - Low-volume areas or property types can have missing or volatile data.

---

## **4. Practical Tips**
1. **Parsing Dates**  
   - You’ll likely want to parse the “Date” column using `pd.to_datetime()` or similar for time-series analysis.
2. **Handling Missing Data**  
   - Some cells may be blank for the newest months or minor geographies with no transactions.
3. **Column Mapping**  
   - If your CSV has no headers, create a list of column names **in the exact order** set out by the dataset documentation.

## **5. Summary**
When working with the UK HPI:
- You’ll likely handle **numeric floats** for prices, indices, and percentage changes.  
- **Integer** values for sales volumes.  
- **String** columns for area codes, region names, and date fields (until parsed).  
- Published in **CSV** and **Linked Data** formats.  
- Requires **mix-adjustment** interpretation: the average price is not a raw average but a geometric mean adjusted for property attributes.

Keeping these data formats and types in mind will help you import, clean, and analyze the dataset effectively in your exercises.

## **Fact Sheet: UK House Price Index (UK HPI)**

### **1. Coverage & Scope**
- **Data Coverage**  
  - England and Wales from January 1995  
  - Scotland from January 2004  
  - Northern Ireland from January 2005 (reported quarterly)  
- **Transactions Included**: All *residential* properties sold for full market value (both **cash** and **mortgage** sales).  
- **Granularity**: National, regional, and local authority levels (including London boroughs).

### **2. Timeliness & Revisions**
- **Completion-based**: The UK HPI is based on *completed* and *registered* sales (rather than advertised or approved mortgage data).  
- **Delay in Registrations**: Since there can be lags (especially for new builds), caution is advised when interpreting the most recent data.  
- **Monthly Revisions**: The UK HPI revises up to 12 months of previous data every month, incorporating newly registered sales (longer for Northern Ireland as it’s quarterly).
- **New Builds**: Transactions involving newly built properties can take longer to appear because they often require the creation of a new register.

### **3. Strengths & Limitations**
- **Strengths**  
  - **Wide coverage**: Includes both cash and mortgage transactions.  
  - **Detailed breakdowns**: Data is available by property type, buyer status (first-time vs. former owner), and funding status (cash vs. mortgage).  
  - **National Statistic**: UK HPI meets the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality, and value.
- **Limitations**  
  - **Less “timely”**: Because it uses completed sales, publication lags behind other price indicators (e.g., Nationwide, Halifax).  
  - **Potential volatility**: Small geographic areas or property sub-groups can show large percentage changes from month to month due to fewer transactions.  
  - **Data Revisions**: Estimates for recent months are provisional and subject to upward revisions as more transactions get registered.

### **4. Data Sources**
1. **HM Land Registry (England & Wales)**:  
   - Main source of price-paid data (PPD).  
   - Excludes commercial and non-market-value transactions.  
2. **Registers of Scotland**:  
   - Similar approach to PPD for Scotland.  
   - Includes transactions of residential properties where buyer or seller might be a company but excludes non-market-value sales.  
3. **Northern Ireland**:  
   - Quarterly data from the Northern Ireland House Price Index (LPS & NISRA).  
4. **UK Finance Regulated Mortgage Survey**:  
   - Provides mortgage-related attributes (e.g., first-time buyer vs. former owner).

### **5. Property Attributes & Methodology**
- **Hedonic Regression**: Adjusts for property characteristics (size, type, location) so the index reflects pure price changes, not just changes in property mix sold.
- **Attribute Data**:
  - **Valuation Office Agency (VOA) Council Tax Valuation list** for England & Wales.  
  - **Land and Property Services NI Valuation List** for Northern Ireland.  
  - **Scottish Energy Performance Certificates (EPC)** for Scotland.  
  - **Acorn classification** (CACI Ltd.) for demographic/geographic segmentation.
- **Geometric Mean**: The UK HPI uses a geometric mean to reduce skew from very high-value properties. 
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Applied at regional and national levels (tables provided).

### **6. Key Indicators & Definitions**
- **Monthly % Change**: Price change vs. the *previous* month.  
- **Annual % Change**: Price change vs. the *same month one year earlier*.  
- **Average Price**: A “standardized” (mix-adjusted) average price, using the geometric mean.  
- **Index**: House price index (January 2015 = 100).  

### **7. Differences from Other House Price Measures**
- **Other indices** (Halifax, Nationwide) may use mortgage approvals only (thus no cash sales).  
- **Rightmove** uses *asking* prices (not final sale prices).  
- **LSL Acadata**: Also uses Land Registry data, but may differ in methodology or timing.

### **8. Access & Licensing**
- **Open Government Licence**: The data is open for reuse with proper attribution:  
  > “Contains HM Land Registry data © Crown copyright and database right 2020. This data is licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.”
- **Data Formats**: CSV, Linked Data (RDF), plus an online search tool.  
- **Attribution & Disclaimer**: Must include references to HM Land Registry copyright. Data providers are not liable for decisions made based on the data.

### **9. Practical Considerations for Analysis**
- **Use Caution with Recent Months**: The last 2 months (especially new builds) may be missing many registrations.  
- **Low Volume Areas**: Smaller local authorities can exhibit large swings. Some tiny districts (e.g., Isles of Scilly) may be excluded entirely.  
- **Partial Sales Volume Data**: Often not published for the newest months to avoid misleading interpretations.

### **10. Release Schedule**
- **Monthly Releases**: Usually second or third Wednesday each month (Northern Ireland updates quarterly).  
- **Publication Dates**: Available in the official release calendar (e.g., the table in Section 10).
